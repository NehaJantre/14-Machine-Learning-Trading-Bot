# Machine Learning Trading Bot

## Application:
In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## Installation Guide


  ### To check that scikit-learn and hvPlot are installed in your Conda dev environment, complete the following steps:

  ### 1. Activate your Conda dev environment (if it isn’t already) by running the following in your terminal:
```
conda activate dev
```
### 2. When the environment is active, run the following in your terminal to check if the scikit-learn, itensorflow and keras libraries are installed on your machine:
```
conda list scikit-learn
```
### If you see scikit-learn, itensorflow and keras listed in the terminal, you’re all set!

  ### 1. Install scikit-learn
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
